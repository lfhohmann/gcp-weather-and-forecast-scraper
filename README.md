# GCP Weather and Forecast Scraper

This is a scraper to run on an F1 (Free Tier) instance of Google Cloud Compute Engine for current weather data from Wunderground Personal Weather Stations and forecast weather data from Google (weather.com).

The idea is to store data over a period of time and analyze the forecast predictions against the actual weather.
